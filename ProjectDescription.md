# CSCE 240 Fall 2021 Final Project - 75 points - Due 12/9/21 at Midnight
Your task will be to create a simple text-based simulation that inherits from a pre-existing World class. The “scenario” in the simulation that you develop can either be one described below in Part 1 or a “scenario” of your choice. However, if you would like to create your own “scenario” that differs significantly from the ones below you must run your idea by me first so that I can approve it. In addition to the creation of your simulation, you will also be in charge of creating a document that describes what you are simulating. This needs to include all of the details or “rules” of your scenario. This is an important step as if I cannot figure out the logic of your simulation then you will likely not receive many points. Lastly, be sure to also read and implement all of the additional considerations at the end of Part 1 (technical program requirements, good programming practices, formatting, commenting, etc.).
